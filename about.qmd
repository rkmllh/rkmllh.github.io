Programming. Programming is the key. From a young age, I was captivated by it, especially C programming. Since then, I have never stopped learning, improving my skills, and exploring the depths of Computer Science. So, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Data Science. 
Otherwise, I am a strong supporter of free information online, online anonymity, and free education. I believe everyone should have access to relevant study materials.

So, If you love low-level Programming, Deep Learning, and Mathematics, you are in the right place. Currently, I'm working with the latter two. So, I'm always on the lookout for new developments in deep learning, from new architectures to new ideas. In my free time, however, I also devote myself to the former, when I can!
