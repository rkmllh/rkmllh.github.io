Hi! I am **Walter Mangione**, a PhD student in **Computer Science and Mathematics** at **Università degli Studi di Bari, Aldo Moro**.

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science** and a **Master’s degree in Data Science**, both _cum laude_.  

My current research focuses on **Alzheimer’s disease**, with an emphasis on **graph-based computational approaches** for understanding its underlying mechanisms.  
I am particularly interested in **state-of-the-art methods for graph construction in brain connectome representations**, including the development and evaluation of different graph-building strategies. I also explore **graph neural networks (GNNs)** for modeling brain connectivity, focusing on **general GNN applications**, as well as the **explainability and interpretability** of these models. Additionally, I am fascinated by the **mathematical foundations of machine learning models**, combining theoretical insights with practical applications to enhance both performance and interpretability.  
I am strongly convinced of the **role and importance of scientific research for humanity**, and I strive to conduct work that contributes meaningfully to both knowledge and societal well-being.
