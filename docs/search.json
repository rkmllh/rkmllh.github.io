    "text": "My Research\nMy current research focuses on brain diseases, with an emphasis on graph-based computational approaches for understanding its underlying mechanisms. I am particularly interested in state-of-the-art methods for graph construction in brain connectome representations , including the development and evaluation of different graph-building strategies. I also explore graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling brain connectivity, focusing on general GNN applications as well as the explainability and interpretability of these models. Additionally, I am interested in investigating large foundation models for diagnostic processing, including both classification and explanation tasks. Finally, I am fascinated by the mathematical foundations of machine learning, combining theoretical insights with practical applications to enhance both performance and interpretability."
