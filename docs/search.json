I am Walter Mangione, a PhD student in Computer Science and Mathematics at Università degli Studi di Bari, Aldo Moro.\nI hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a Master’s degree in Data Science, both cum laude.\nMyAA current research focuses on Alzheimer’s disease, with an emphasis on graph-based computational approaches for understanding its underlying mechanisms.\nI am particularly interested in state-of-the-art methods for graph construction in brain connectome representations, including the development and evaluation of different graph-building strategies. I also explore graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling brain connectivity, focusing on general GNN applications, as well as the explainability and interpretability of these models. Additionally, I am fascinated by the mathematical foundations of machine learning models, combining theoretical insights with practical applications to enhance both performance and interpretability.\nI am strongly convinced of the role and importance of scientific research for humanity, and I strive to conduct work that contributes meaningfully to both knowledge and societal well-being."
